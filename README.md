# Regression Model Analysis

This repository explores the development and refinement of regression models for predictive analytics.

## Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Outliers and missing values were handled in the dataset.

2. **Baseline Model**: A basic linear regression model was trained initially.

3. **Regularized Regression (Lasso)**: Lasso regression was used for feature selection, identifying and reducing less significant features.

4. **Refined Model**: Another linear regression model was trained using the selected subset of features identified by Lasso.

## Results

- The baseline and refined models showed comparable performance.
- Lasso regression effectively reduced the feature set while maintaining model score.
